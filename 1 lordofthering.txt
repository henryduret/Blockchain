introduction: The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar Tolkien; written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.

moreintroduction: The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth; from quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuckand Peregrin "Pippin" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard.

prologue: Thousands of years before the events of the novel, the Dark Lord Sauron had forged the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wore them: the leaders of Men, Elves and Dwarves; Sauron was defeated by an alliance of Elves and Men led by Gil-galad and Elendil, respectively; in the final battle, Isildur, son of Elendil, cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger, causing Sauron to lose his physical form; Isildur claimed the Ring as an heirloom for his line, but when he was later ambushed and killed by the Orcs, the Ring was lost in the River Anduin.

moreprologue: Over two thousand years later, the Ring was found by one of the river-folk called Déagol; his friend Sméagol fell under the Ring's influence and strangled Déagol to acquire it; Sméagol was banished and hid under the Misty Mountains; the Ring gave him long life and changed him over hundreds of years into a twisted, corrupted creature called Gollum; Gollum lost the Ring, his "precious", and as told in The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins found it; meanwhile, Sauron assumed a new form and took back his old realm of Mordor; when Gollum set out in search of the Ring, he was captured and tortured by Sauron; Sauron learned from Gollum that "Baggins" of the Shire had taken the Ring; Gollum was set loose; Sauron, who needed the Ring to regain his full power, sent forth his powerful servants, the Nazgûl, to seize it.

thefellowship: the story begins in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo Baggins, his cousin and guardian; Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be Sauron's Ring; seventeen years later, after Gandalf confirms his guess, he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire; Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener, servant and friend, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took; they are nearly caught by the Black Riders, but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest; there they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.

morethefellowship: the hobbits reach the town of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider, whom Gandalf had mentioned in a letter; Strider persuades the hobbits to take him on as their guide and protector; together, they leave Bree after another close escape from the Black Riders; on the hill of Weathertop, they are again attacked by the Black Riders, who wound Frodo with a cursed blade; Strider fights them off and leads the hobbits towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell; Frodo falls deathly ill from the wound; the Black Riders nearly capture him at the Ford of Bruinen, but flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them.

influences: The Lord of the Rings developed as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in philology, religion, fairy tales, Norse and general Germanic mythology, and also Celtic, Slavic, Persian, Greek, and Finnish mythology; Tolkien acknowledged, and external critics have verified, the influences of George MacDonald and William Morris and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf; The question of a direct influence of Wagner's The Nibelung's Ring on Tolkien's work is debated by critics.

moreinfluences: Tolkien included neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work; Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of The Lord of the Rings reflect his Catholic worldview; In one of his letters Tolkien states, "The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision; That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world; For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism".

legacy: The enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy fiction; Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s, and enjoys popularity to the present day; The opus has spawned many imitators, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called "the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read"; Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features many races found in The Lord of the Rings, most notably halflings, elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons; However, Gary Gygax, lead designer of the game, maintained that he was influenced very little by The Lord of the Rings, stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.

funfact1: When The Lord of the Rings started out, it was originally going to be two movies; Later, concerned about the ballooning budget, producers tried to persuade Jackson to condense the movie into a single film; At various points in the scripting process, Arwen, not Éowyn, was the one to dress up as a man, ride into the Battle of Pelennor Fields, and kill the Witch-king; and Rohan and Gondor were combined into one kingdom; Miramax also suggested that the one-movie version be presented as a flashback, with an older Frodo covering [the entire Mines of Moria sequence in Fellowship] by saying something like, So then we went on a dangerous journey through the Mines of Moria and lost Gandalf!, recalled Jackson.

funfact2: Sean Connery read for the role of Gandalf but admitted that, I never understood it; I read the book; I read the script; I saw the movie; I still dont understand it  I would be interested in doing something that I didnt fully understand, but not for 18 months; Connerys deal, if he had taken the role, would have been for a small fee plus 15 percent of the films income; Incidentally, the entire trilogy went on to earn just shy of $3 billion worldwide.

funfact3: Nicolas Cage was offered the role of Aragorn, which he turned down due to family obligations; Famously, the role then went to up-and-coming Irish actor Stuart Townsend, who you probably dont remember seeing in the final trilogy: I was there rehearsing and training for two months, then was fired the day before filming began, the actor later recalled; In need of an older actor, Jackson went to Viggo Mortensen, who took the role at the urging of his son Henry, who was a fan of the books.

funfact4: Had Mortensen turned down the role of Aragorn, there were two other actors Jackson had in mind as replacements: Jason Patric and Russell Crowe; We sent [Crowe] a script and he did read it and was fascinated, said Jackson; I remember getting the phone call from his agent and being told that he had just finished another film which involved him having to have a sword and armorGladiator! Russell was flattered by the approach, but he had other films he was committed to and it obviously wasnt going to work out.

funfact5: A variety of injuries beset the cast during production, but Mortensen had it particularly hard: in The Two Towers, that scream he let out upon kicking a helmet after discovering the burnt corpses of the Orcs who abducted Merry and Pippin might have something to do with the fact that he had just broken two of his toes; Normally, an actor would yell Ow! if they hurt themselves, noted Jackson; Viggo turned a broken toe into a performance; Elijah Wood remembered Mortensen getting half of his tooth knocked out during a fight sequence, and his insistence on applying superglue to put it back in to keep working.

funfact6: Jake Gyllenhaal had a less-than-successful audition for the role of Frodo; I remember auditioning for The Lord of the Rings and going in and not being told that I needed a British accent; I really do remember Peter Jackson saying to me, You know that you have to do this in a British accent? Gyllenhaal later recalled; We heard back it was literally one of the worst auditions.

funfact7: Among other could-have-beens in the casting department: Vin Diesel auditioned for Aragorn; Jackson called his performance very compelling but said that it didnt feel like Aragorn; Jackson approached Richard OBrien, best known as Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (which he also wrote), for the role of Gríma Wormtongue, but his agents turned it down, believing the films would be unsuccessful; Liam Neeson passed on the role of Boromir.

funfact8: The Lord of the Rings trilogy marked a return to the Shire for Bilbo actor Ian Holm, who played Frodo in a 1981 radio dramatization of The Lord of the Rings, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4; His performance in that factored into Jacksons decision to offer him the Bilbo role.

funfact9: The late Christopher Lee was a Lord of the Rings superfan who actually met J;R;R; Tolkien (I was very much in awe of him, as you can imagine, he told Cinefantastique) and wanted to robe up as Gandalf, a role that eventually went to Sir Ian McKellen; (Lee himself admitted that, by the time the movies came around, he was too old for the action-heavy role;) Lee even played a wizard in the TV series The New Adventures of Robin Hood specifically to show anyone who was watching that I could play a wizard and that I would be ideal casting for The Lord of the Rings; He sent Jackson a picture of himself in wizard duds, though it was more in the nature of a joke, really; It wasnt me putting myself forward at all, because I think Peter had already made up his mind to cast him as the wizard Saruman.

funfact10: Early on in the development process, before it found its eventual home at New Line Cinema, The Lord of the Rings trilogy was being made at Miramax; As Peter Jackson would later recall, Bob Weinstein really, really thought one of the four main Hobbits should die: Well, we cant have [all of them surviving], he said, weve got to kill a Hobbit! I dont care which one; you can pickIm not telling you who it should be: you pick out who you want to kill, but weve really got to kill one of those Hobbits! In situations like that, you just nod and smile and say, Well, thats something we can consider.
